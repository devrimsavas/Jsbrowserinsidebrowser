hi. it is very easy but essential program about DOM document (module 2.1 part 1). Here i used a simple iframe and buttons. Program takes input and show link inside browser. Quite easy but related to Module 2.1. Program also records visited sites and allow you re-visit them.  However it is not possible to open all sites in this way due to "same-origin policy" .anyway easy but not too bad..program adds "http://www." prefix automatically.
